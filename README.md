# masters_thesis
This is R markdowns for my master thesis where all the sprint data is read and visualized and collected in one final markdown that is called "sprint".

Further more this repository includes a Mathematica file where all the models are developed, it is a file that is for my use but uploaded so that a censor and my supervisor   can look at it.
